00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
Words and language, no matter what anybody
tells you,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.400
words and ideas can change the world. Now
see that

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.840
look at Mr. Pitt's eye, like 19th century
literature has nothing to do with going to

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.120
business school or medical school, right?
Maybe. Mr.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.320
Hopkins, you may agree with them thinking,
yes, we should simply study our Mr.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.200
Pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter
and go quietly about the business of

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.480
achieving other ambitions. A little secret
for you.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.820
Huddle up. Huddle up!

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.340
We don't read and write poetry because
it's cute.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.000
We read and write poetry because we are
members of the human race,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.620
and the human race is filled with passion.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.760
Medicine, law, business, engineering,
these are noble pursuits and necessary to

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.300
sustain life. But poetry, beauty,

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.660
romance, love, these are what we stay
alive for.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.240
To quote from Whitman, oh me, oh life

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.980
of the questions of these recurring, of
the endless trains of the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.480
faithless, of cities filled with the
foolish, what good amid these,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.460
oh me, oh life? Answer, that you

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.120
are here, that life exists and identity,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.560
that the powerful play goes on and you may
contribute a verse.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.660
That the powerful play goes on and you may

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.880
contribute a verse.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.340
What will your verse be?
